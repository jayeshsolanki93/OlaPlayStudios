# OlaPlayStudios
Android App for the Ola Android Hiring Challenge on HackerEarth.

It is 100% Kotlin app, follows a MVP architecture. I tried to imitate the work done in the todo-mvp samples here:
https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture

Complete features:
- Download data from API and populate a list
- Play song from the list
- Save songs to a user's playlist
- Search a song in the list and play
- A portfolio page

Features which I didn't complete:
- Download and play music offline
- Pagination

### Libaries Used:
- RxJava 2
- Dagger 2
- OkHttp
- Retrofit
- Glide for image loading
- ExoPlayer as the media player for playing music
